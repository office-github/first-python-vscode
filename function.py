'''
Important warning: The default value is evaluated only once.
This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes.
For example, the following function accumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:
'''


def f1(a, L=[]):
    L.append(a)
    return L


print(f1(1))
print(f1(2))
print(f1(3))

# output:
# [1]
# [1, 2]
# [1, 2, 3]

'''
If you donâ€™t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you can write the function like this instead:
'''


def f2(a, L=None):
    if L is None:
        L = []
    L.append(a)
    return L


print(f2(1))
print(f2(2))
print(f2(3))

# output:
# [1]
# [2]
# [3]
